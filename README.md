# Connect-Four
Two different verions:
1) Player versus Player
2) Player versus Server 

Player versus server needs a backend (server side) to play which is not included in this repository.

Warning: Code may be hard to read and may not be well organized or well written. This code was created during the second introductory classes of programming.

Commands (where # is the column number):

-DROP # 

-POP #


DISCLAIMER: Some of the code is not my code. It was given to me by the professor of the course to help with the mechanics of the game. Specifically the connectfour.py file. I do not take credit for creating nor writing the code in that file.
